# Project Description
The 7 Segment Clock is a simple combination of a Particle Argon and an Adafruit 7 Segment Display module to create an internet connected clock. The goal of this project was for me to get exposure to designing wiring schematics, the PCB printing process, and writing code for the Particle Argon. 

I created 5 clocks and distributed them to friends and family. I can monitor each of these clocks and push remote updates to them through the Particle IDE. This GitHub repo documents my project.
